This is a form that I created in my client-side scripting class.

I created the form with HTML and styled with CSS. I used DOM scripting to put error or confirmation cues next to each input section if they met certain requirements which were set using Regex. The form will not submit unless all fields are completed correctly.

There is a small quiz at the end which determines your personality (artist or programmer) after you submit. When the form is submitted, it returns the information that was inputted using DOM Scripting.
